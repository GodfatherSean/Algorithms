# Google Foobar Coding Challenge

The Google Foobar Coding Challenge does exist! Please visit it [here](https://foobar.withgoogle.com). An advice is that the problems in higher levels are generally not about traditional algorithms such as greedy or dynamic programming; many of them are highly mathematical! The UC Berkeley Introduction to CS Theories ([CS70](https://eecs70.org)) and Introduction to Algorithms ([CS170](https://cs170.org)) are very helpful, where Markov chains, RSA cryptography scheme, and maximum matching problems are addressed.

## Levels 1-2

The problems are trivial even for a beginner programmer, so no code has been uploaded.

## Level 3

### Problem 3-1

A bricks stacking problem. Use recursion and cache the results.

### Problem 3-2

Absorbing Markov Chain. Refer to [wikipedia](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Markov_chain) or [CS70](https://eecs70.org).

### Problem 3-3

An optimization problem. Use greedy and recursion. Cache the results to boost performance.

## Level 4

### Problem 4-1

Graph construction and maximum matching. Refer to [here](https://www.ics.uci.edu/~eppstein/PADS/CardinalityMatching.py).

### Problem 4-2

Binomial combinations counting and generating. Easy to model using binary strings.
