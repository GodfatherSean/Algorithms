# CodeVS

This is a Chinese online algorithm community providing algorithm practices and competitions. The difficulty of the exercises varies from introductory level to advanced level. With topic such as *data structure*, *dynamic programming*, *greedy*, and *searching*, it is a perfect place to make me more familiar with both cpp and basic algorithms.

However, the platform may only work for Chinese codes, since the whole website is written in Chinese.
